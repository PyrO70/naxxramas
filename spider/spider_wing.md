### Abilities

#### Boss
- Poison Bolt Volley
  - Viscidus like
  - Dispellable, Resistable
  - **1450 Nature dmg** + **450 dmg / 2 seconds** for 4 seconds
  - **10** persons
- Rain of Fire
  - Gehennas like
  - **2000 dmg / tick**
  - Resistable

     - Stop Poison Bolt Volley for 30 seconds
   - No enrage: Delay enrage by 30sec (No sure if that)
     - Add 30seconds to enrage time

#### Add (Worshipper x4, Followers x2)
- Worshipper
  - 250 000 HP
  - MC to dispell enrage or delay
- Followers
  - 100 000 HP
  - Stunnable

### Strategy

Cleave down the Followers on Faerlina. Off-tanking of the Worshipper on the side. Once the Followers are down, focus Faerlina. Depending on raid DPS we might play safe and silence Faerlina before she enrages, so prevent the MT from being killed, or we wait for the full 60sec and dispell only after the enrage occured. Ranged must be spread around the room to prevent Rain of Fire from hitting too many ppl at once.

- All Tank

### Ranged

- Move away from Rain of Fire
- Use **fire potion** to prevent dmg
- Use **poison elixir** on Poison Bolt Volley

### Melee
